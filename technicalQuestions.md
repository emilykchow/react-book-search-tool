1.	How long did you spend on the coding assignment? 
    -About 15 hours, I was out of the country for a week, so I had to finish the assessment when I came back
a.	What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    -I would have made the UI look better, as well as maybe when the user clicks on the book image, it will bring the user to a place where they can buy the book.
b.	If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
    -N/A, I did spend time on the coding test
2.	What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
3.	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
    -The Open Library API was very flawed. For example, the published dates, there were a lot of dates, and some books even had undefined dates. To work around this, I made a function that if the published year === undefined, I would filter it out.
4.	How would you improve the API that you just used?
    -I'd make sure that the data are all available, the dates would be formatted the same way instead of random days/years/undefined. I would make sure that the documentation was more detailed and easily understood.
5.	Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
